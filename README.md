# Surfs_Up_Challenge
## Overview
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results

1. The average temperature in June is 75 and December is 71 degrees.
2. The maximum temperature in June is 85 and December is 83 degrees.
3. The minimum temperature in June is 64 and December is 56 degrees.
## Summary
Based on the outcomes, even though temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those June, with only a 4 degree average difference, December would still be sustainable for the business for both surfing and ice cream.

Two additional queries I would make are:
1. I would take a look at other factors in play during both months. These would be in the categories of average rain, wind and tide. These could all effect the desire for going to the beach during those times.
2. I would also would look into specific areas of the island and determine which may be the best location to set up the shop. This could be determined by population, popularity with tourists, and availability of other similar shops in the area.
